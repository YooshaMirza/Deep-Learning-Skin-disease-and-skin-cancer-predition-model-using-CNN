## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Workflow

Our approach is structured to build a robust and highly accurate classification model from the ground up.

1.  **Data Preparation & Augmentation:** To prevent overfitting and improve model generalization, we employ extensive data augmentation techniques using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. This includes rotations, shifts, zooms, and flips to create a diverse and rich training dataset.
2.  **Custom CNN Model Architecture:** We designed a unique CNN architecture tailored for the specific features of skin lesion images. This custom model proved more efficient and accurate than generic, pre-trained models for this specific task.
3.  **Comparative Model Training:** We trained our custom model alongside several established architectures (VGG16, MobileNet, Inception V3, Sequential CNN) on the exact same dataset to create a fair and comprehensive performance benchmark.
4.  **Advanced Model Tuning:** The model was fine-tuned using techniques like learning rate scheduling, early stopping, and dropout regularization to achieve optimal performance.
5.  **Evaluation:** The model's final performance was evaluated based on key metrics, with a primary focus on classification accuracy.

## üìä Performance & Results

Our custom-designed CNN model demonstrated superior performance across the board.

-   **Classification Accuracy:** **96.64%**
-   **Efficiency:** Our model processed images faster while maintaining higher precision compared to the benchmarked pre-trained models.
